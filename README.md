# Project---Auto-Insurance-Data


The purpose of this analysis is to help us better understand our customers and how they interact with their insurance policies so we can make smarter, fairer, and more effective business decisions. Insurance is about protecting people from unexpected events, such as car accidents or property damage, while ensuring the cost of that protection remains fair and balanced. Many customers find insurance complex because it involves predicting future risks and preparing for situations that may never happen. This analysis will simplify that complexity by using customer information to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that support better decision-making.

The analysis aims to answer important questions like who our customers are, what their education levels and jobs are, what their family situations look like, and how these differences affect their insurance needs and risks. Some customers might be at higher risk of filing claims, while others rarely file any claims at all. We also want to understand what factors influence how much customers pay for their insurance, which helps ensure that pricing is fair and transparent for everyone. Another key goal is to identify which customer groups are most valuable to our business over the long term, not just based on one payment but based on loyalty and overall lifetime value.

By looking at customer details such as where they live, their education, their employment, their marital status, the number of complaints they have made, and their past claim history, we can identify patterns that reveal which groups are riskier, which ones are loyal, and which ones contribute most to the companyâ€™s growth. These insights will help us improve the way we serve our customers by offering more personalized insurance policies that meet their unique needs, managing risk more effectively so claims can be handled quickly and fairly, ensuring pricing is competitive and accurate, and improving the overall customer experience by better understanding what different types of customers truly value.

In simple terms, this analysis is about taking a closer look at our customers so we can serve them better, price our products more fairly, and make the company stronger and more efficient in the long run.
